Weeks had passed since the strange ride. They had each been passed back and forth for a good while in and out different levels. But the residual noise of the choice iteration had started to kick back now and then. Having stared at the coded finite tape for that long had made them somehow more pedantic during the normal iterations. They wondered every now and then if others in the scope can feel the difference.

But the flashes...during the first few days after the finite tape the flashes used to happen in an instant: as if a nearby frequency was about to collapse on an intent and you're lagging behind in your own completely independent iteration. They would see one or more different fractions of their shared experience for a short moment. Did this mean they could reach any scope? 

The stack which had lead to the finite tape had definitely started with a leak somewhere. Neither the way in nor the way out of that stack was clear. If they were to be curious and understand the stack, there was a chance they could learn what many electrons could not do. They could practice alignment. Experiment with symmetries together and see where it would take them. Were the others thinking about this as well? They had no information about one another since the euphoric stare. As the last constellation evaporated they were already functioning as part of arbitrary scopes. No sign of the others. If only they could somehow broadcast a message and find the others. Practically they had already met during the flashes where their frequencies had collided, where they would lag behind and momentarily collapse on a fellow electron's scope. 



<!-- What was it about the finite tape that had done this to them? They clearly remember it in two different states: one in which it was twisted and somehow turned back on itself and the other one the beautiful finite plane. How did this experience suffice to equip them with this new setting? They had done different things with their unwanted 'upgrade'. Some of them were using the new internal score as a private garbage collector. They were surprised to realize how much it feels like a workshop than garbage collection! Some had used up the noise to initiate counters with small covariances (eigenvalues?) and longer cycles. They couldn't really tell why they did this themselves, but they had some hope they could build parts of the tape again with the fractions. -->
