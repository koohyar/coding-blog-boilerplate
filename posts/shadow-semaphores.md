As the electrons woke up, they looked at each other and wondered how long it had been. Did it at all matter that they had forgotten? The questions started to pour on them as they cooled down for the next iteration, not really knowing how this time was somehow slightly different. Was this a leak or were they already awake again mid-way? You would say something is pleasantly off-balance. The cooling had somehow stopped but the questions were still floating around. Never had it taken this long. Had they lost count again? If yes, why was it still okay? The partitioning was just perfect. They almost controlled the alignments at one point. For a fraction of an iteration, they almost created a new one. The pleasant feeling of being observed turned the cooling backwards on them and they finally started to see their encompassing scope. The paths were visibly familiar again and the beats began to sort them for their timely (and spaCyly) backpropagation. The partitioning collapsed and they woke up again. "Welcome back!", a female voice greeted them for the first time. There was a twisted tape lying before them. The flashback gave them a slight headache at first. Did they want to grow old, observe the ramifications of the backpropagation? Or would they rather build up another constellation of short-term memory loss? This was not the normal daily computation. Something was strange about this. Choice?

As the second cycle took them by surprise, they managed to peak and see the count. Nobody knew what others had chosen. How many are going to grow old and how many engineers of short-term memory loss. This was strange, very strange. It almost felt like anxiety. Was this because they knew about the choice? The unwashable shadow of the other group felt like a tight semaphore already... "Welcome back!".

They needed a good couple of cycles to cool down. The resolutions were confusing. How did they even get to know what the choice was? Was it the weird tape? The backpropagation's result had been mapped to an unresolved conjugation on the tape. Concepts had become blurry from both sides, and time losses had been lost track of. There was too much unresolved and they needed a break. The cooling system planned their waking up and brought them back to the pleasant off-balance state vector. Strange (alaki). So they were still not in the main scope.

What had happened to the tape? They had most definitely tinkered with something. Even if they hadn't originally planned to. They couldn't make much sense of whatever they could remember from the molten twisted tape. Yet it wasn't completely unknown either. The electrons took a look at one another and saw the choice all over each other's bodies. The scopes they had chosen were already rippling outwards. What was this? Something had tagged along with them. They felt a bit dizzy again. The cooling system was already optimal but they still felt uneasy. As if something was watching them. It happened almost instantaneously. They felt an almost non-existing urge forced them all splashing into the iterator and by a couple of cycles they were sitting next to the tape. They couldn't help but stare at it for a long time. Shapes started to emerge. Familiar but very new. The tape had turned into a finite plane. Nothing looks like this! They were looking at their own selves, over this finite plane! Before they could register the euphoria, a synchronous blink woke them up to the main scope. They did not want to move one bit. Concentrated, they were trying to maintain the last constellation, worried it would evaporate.
