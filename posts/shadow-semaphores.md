As the electrons woke up, they looked at each other and wondered how long it had been. Did it at all matter that they had forgotten? The questions started pouring on them as they cooled down for the next iteration, not really knowing how this time was somehow slightly different. Was this a leak or were they already awake again mid-way? You would say something is pleasantly off-balance. The cooling had somehow stopped but the questions were still floating around. Never had it taken this long. Had they lost count again? If yes, why was it still okay? The partitioning was just perfect. Theyalmost controled the alignments at one point. For a fraction of an iteration, they almost created a new one. The pleasant feeling of being oversved turned the cooling backwards on them and they finally started to see their encompassing scope. The paths were visibly familiar again and the beats began to sort them for their timely (and spaCyly) backprogataion. The partitioning collapsed and they woke up again. "Welcome back!", a female voice greeted them for the first time. There was a twisted tape lying before them. The flashback gave them a slight headache at first. It was another choice. Did they want to grow old, observe the ramifications of the backpropagation? Or would they rather build up another constellation of short-term memory loss? This was not the normal daily computation. Something was strange about this. Choice? 

As the second wave took them by surprise, they managed to peak and see the count. Nobody knew what others had chosen. How many are going to grow old and how many engineers of short-term memory loss. This was strange, very strange. It almost felt like anxiety. Was this because they knew about the choice? The unwashable shadow of the other group felt like a tight semaphore already... "Welcome back!".  

Something had changed about the twisted tape. The backpropagation's result had been mapped to an unresolved conjugation. Concepts had become blurry from both sides, and time losses had been lost track of. They needed a break. The cooling system planned their waking up and brought them back to the pleasant off-balance state vector.
